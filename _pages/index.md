### Welcome to DBSDS—Dan Byer Social Data Science

I'm Dan Byer: a retired Army Major, sociologist-in-training, and social data scientist.  
I use modern data tools to tackle social questions, support research, and inform public decision-making.

This site showcases my work at the intersection of:
- 📊 Data science and sociology  
- 🏛️ Civic leadership and public service  
- 📍 Local insights and national themes  

Whether you're a **researcher looking for data collaboration** or a **municipality facing complex decisions**, I help you translate social complexity into actionable insight.

### ⚡ Recent Focus: The Future of Work

The world of work is changing—fast.  
Through my ASA-aligned data projects, I explore:

- Where labor precarity is growing  
- How people talk about organizing online  
- What job postings say about work expectations  
- How remote work is reshaping cities like Moline and the Quad Cities

> **My mission:** use data not just to describe the world, but to improve it.
