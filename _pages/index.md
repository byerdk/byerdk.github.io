## 👋 Welcome to DBSDS — Dan Byer Social Data Science

I'm Dan Byer: a retired Army Major, sociologist-in-training, and social data scientist.  
I use modern data tools to tackle social questions, support research, and inform public decision-making.

This site showcases my work at the intersection of:

- 📊 **Data science and sociology**  
- 🏛️ **Civic leadership and public service**  
- 📍 **Local insight and national themes**

Whether you're a **researcher looking for data collaboration** or a **municipality facing complex decisions**, I help translate social complexity into **actionable insight**.

## ❓ Questions We Can Answer Together

> Real-world decisions deserve real insight.  
> These are the kinds of questions social data science can help solve:

- Where are the **best opportunities** for small contractors in my city?
- What does job data tell us about **changing expectations** in the workforce?
- How are **different neighborhoods impacted** by city policy?
- Who’s organizing online, and what are they saying?
- What barriers are facing workers — and what does the data say?

## ⚡ Current Focus: The Future of Work

The world of work is changing—fast.  
Through ASA-aligned projects and civic consulting demos, I explore:

- 📉 Where labor precarity is growing  
- 💬 How workers and organizers talk about work online  
- 🧠 What job postings reveal about expectations  
- 🏙️ How remote work is reshaping places like Moline and the Quad Cities

> 🎯 **My mission:** Use data not just to describe the world—but to improve it.
