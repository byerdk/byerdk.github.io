## 🧰 Welcome to the Contractor & Small Biz Data Hub

This hub is for the people who *get it done*: small business owners, contractors, and tradespeople looking to grow their work, win bids, and stay focused on the jobs that matter most.

I’m here to help with:

- 🎯 Focusing your business on the kind of work you want
- 🔎 Finding and tracking real project opportunities
- 🧾 Submitting cleaner, clearer estimates and proposals
- 📊 Understanding local trends using public data

### 🚀 Step 1: Focus Your Work

Before you chase every job out there, take 10 minutes to think about what **you actually want to do** — and where that work is happening.

#### ✅ Quick Focus Checklist:
- What type of jobs are you best at?
- What type of clients do you want more of?
- Where are those jobs posted?
- Do you want small, fast jobs — or big, long ones?

### 📋 Step 3: Submit Stronger Proposals

**Most contractors don’t lose bids because of price — they lose because of clarity.**

Here’s a free checklist to make sure your proposals hit the mark:
- [ ] Scope is clear and specific
- [ ] Your business info and licenses are listed
- [ ] Timeline and payment expectations are clear
- [ ] Materials/labor are itemized (if needed)
- [ ] No typos or formatting mess
